A chatbot is an AI-driven software program designed to simulate conversations with users through text or voice. These tools are popular across various industries for providing instant customer support, automating repetitive tasks, and delivering information efficiently.
A chatbot is a computer program designed to have conversations with people. It can answer questions, help with tasks like booking appointments, or even recommend products based on user input. There are two main types of chatbots: simple ones that follow set rules and advanced ones that use artificial intelligence (AI) to understand and respond to more complex questions. Many chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to better understand human language. Python is commonly used to build chatbots, using libraries like NLTK to help the bot understand words and phrases. Chatbots can be used on websites, in messaging apps, or through other digital platforms to make customer interactions easier and faster.
